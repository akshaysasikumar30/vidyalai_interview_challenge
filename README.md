## Progress and Experience
- Thankyou for giving me this oppertunity.Unfortunately, I couldn't complete 2 tasks due to my limited experience, especially when it came to tasks like "changing class component to function component". I had to 
  refer to online resources for guidance, as my knowledge is still evolving, particularly in handling larger and live projects.

- However, I want to emphasize that I am a fast learner and dedicated to improving. I'm eager to tackle the remaining tasks and contribute effectively to the project in any way possible.
